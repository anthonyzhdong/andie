/**
 * This class represents a listener for drawing points on an ImagePanel. It extends the ShapeListener class,
 * which is an abstract class for the listener class of each shape. It also extends the MouseInputAdapter class
 * for handling mouse input events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The initial code for this class was adapted from the Oracle documentation on mouse motion listeners for Swing events.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class provides functionality to draw points on the ImagePanel. It tracks the coordinates of the points being drawn
 * and applies the points to the image on mouse release. The drawn points can be customized with the shape color and radius.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class contains overridden methods from the MouseInputAdapter class to handle mouse events such as mouse dragging,
 * mouse pressing, and mouse releasing. It also includes helper methods to update the point position based on the mouse
 * coordinates, as well as getters and setters for the point coordinates. The point drawing operation is applied to the image
 * on mouse release.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/mousemotionlistener.html">Oracle Mouse Motion Listener Tutorial</a>
 * was used as a reference to create the initial point selection for the ImagePanel, which was then adapted to suit
 * the requirements of ANDIE (Analog and Digital Image Editing).
