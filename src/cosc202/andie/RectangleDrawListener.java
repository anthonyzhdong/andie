/**
 * This class represents a listener for drawing rectangles on an ImagePanel. It extends the ShapeListener class,
 * which is an abstract class for the listener class of each shape. It also extends the MouseInputAdapter class
 * for handling mouse input events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The initial code for this class was adapted from the Oracle documentation on mouse motion listeners for Swing events.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class provides functionality to draw rectangles on the ImagePanel. It tracks the coordinates of the rectangle, including
 * the initial point, the current point being drawn, and the final point. The rectangle appearance can be customized with
 * the shape outline color, fill color, line width, and options for filling and outlining the shape. The drawn rectangle is
 * applied to the image on mouse release.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class contains overridden methods from the MouseInputAdapter class to handle mouse events such as mouse dragging,
 * mouse pressing, and mouse releasing. It also includes helper methods to update the rectangle size and position based on
 * the mouse coordinates, as well as getters and setters for the rectangle coordinates. The rectangle drawing operation is
 * applied to the image on mouse release.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/mousemotionlistener.html">Oracle Mouse Motion Listener Tutorial</a>
 * was used as a reference to create the initial rectangle selection for the ImagePanel, which was then adapted to suit
 * the requirements of ANDIE (Analog and Digital Image Editing).
